    <p>I am an Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">University of Michigan School of Information</a>.
      Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/newyork/">Microsoft Research New York</a>.
      I received my PhD from the <a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu">Computer Science Department</a> at University of California, Santa Barbara in December 2012.
      I received my Bachelors degree from <a href="http://cs.bilkent.edu.tr/index.php?p=index&l=en">Computer Science Dept. @Bilkent University</a> in Turkey in 2007.</p>
    <p>My research interests lie in the area of computational social science;
  	a discipline at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and the social sciences.
  	I am particularly interested in applying large scale data analysis techniques to study problems with social,
  	political, and policy implications.</p>
